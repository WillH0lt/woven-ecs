## Why Woven-ECS?

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Multithreaded" icon="rocket">
    Run systems in parallel across Web Workers with zero-copy SharedArrayBuffer data sharing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Type-Safe" icon="seti:typescript">
    Full TypeScript support with strongly typed components, queries, and field definitions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Data-Oriented" icon="bars">
    Components store typed data in SharedArrayBuffers for memory efficiency and cache-friendly access.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reactive" icon="refresh">
    Built-in event system tracks entity and component changes with efficient queries for added, removed, and changed entities.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Features

- **Zero-Copy Threading**: SharedArrayBuffer enables data sharing across threads without serialization
- **Rich Field Types**: Numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, tuples, enums, and entity references
- **Powerful Queries**: Filter entities by component presence with `with`, `without`, and `any` operators
- **Change Tracking**: Query for entities that were added, removed, or changed since last frame
- **Singletons**: First-class support for global state like time, input, and configuration
- **Entity References**: Reference other entities with automatic validation
