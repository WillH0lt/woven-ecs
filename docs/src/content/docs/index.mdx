## Why Woven-ECS?

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Easy to Use" icon="lucide:lightbulb">
    Straightforward API for defining components, creating entities, and writing systems. Full type-safety with TypeScript.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reactive Queries" icon="lucide:search">
    Track all changes to entities and components automatically. Query for entities that were **added**, **removed**, or **changed** since the last frame.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Built-in Multithreading" icon="lucide:spool">
    Run heavy workloads in parallel without any jank. Effortlessly distribute work across multiple CPU cores, no manual thread management required.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Open Source" icon="lucide:file-code">
    Read the source code, create issues, and contribute on GitHub. We welcome contributions and feedback as the project grows.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## What it Looks Like

```typescript
import {
  addComponent,
  createEntity,
  defineComponent,
  defineQuery,
  defineSystem,
  field,
  World,
} from '@woven-ecs/core';

// Define components with typed fields
const Position = defineComponent({
  x: field.float32(),
  y: field.float32(),
});

const Velocity = defineComponent({
  x: field.float32(),
  y: field.float32(),
});

// Define a query to find entities with both components
const movingEntities = defineQuery((q) =>
  q.with(Position, Velocity)
);

// Define a system to process matching entities
const movementSystem = defineSystem((ctx) => {
  for (const eid of movingEntities.current(ctx)) {
    const pos = Position.write(ctx, eid);
    const vel = Velocity.read(ctx, eid);
    pos.x += vel.x;
    pos.y += vel.y;
  }
});

// Create the world
const world = new World([Position, Velocity]);

// Initialize with an entity
world.execute((ctx) => {
  const eid = createEntity(ctx);
  addComponent(ctx, eid, Position, { x: 0, y: 0 });
  addComponent(ctx, eid, Velocity, { x: 1, y: 1 });
});

// Game loop
function loop() {
  world.execute(movementSystem);
  requestAnimationFrame(loop);
}

loop();
```

## Features

- **Powerful Queries**: Filter entities by component presence with `with`, `without`, and `any` operators
- **Change Tracking**: Query for entities that were added, removed, or changed since last frame
- **Rich Field Types**: Numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, tuples, enums, binary, and entity references
- **Singletons**: First-class support for global state like time, input, and configuration
- **Multithreading**: Execute systems in parallel across worker threads with automatic entity partitioning
- **Entity References**: Reference other entities with automatic validation

## Build Collaborative Applications

The [`@woven-ecs/canvas-store`](/canvas-store/introduction/) and [`@woven-ecs/canvas-store-server`](/canvas-store/server-setup/) packages extend Woven-ECS with everything you need to build multiplayer editor applications like infinite canvases or other creative design tools.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Real-time Sync" icon="lucide:users">
    WebSocket-based multiplayer with conflict resolution. Multiple users can edit the same document simultaneously.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Local-First" icon="lucide:house-heart">
    Your app works offline by default. Data lives on the client and syncs to the server when connected.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Undo/Redo" icon="lucide:undo-2">
    Full history tracking with configurable depth. Users can undo and redo changes across sessions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Persistence" icon="lucide:database">
    Automatic IndexedDB storage for offline support. Changes are saved locally and synced when back online.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Migrations" icon="lucide:git-branch">
    Version your component schemas with automatic migrations. Evolve your data model without breaking existing documents.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Configurable" icon="lucide:settings-2">
    Configure sync behavior per component: persist to server, sync ephemerally, store locally, or skip entirely.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
